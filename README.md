## To-Do List


### Selector Strategy
- [ ] Identify and test CSS selectors, XPath, or text selectors for each target job application platform.
- [ ] Implement robust and dynamic selector handling to manage variations and updates in web forms.

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for each functional component (handlers, data loaders, browser management).
- [ ] Conduct dry runs with test data to ensure scripts perform actions correctly without actual form submissions.

### Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Develop comprehensive error handling strategies to manage timeouts, incorrect data, and navigation errors.
- [ ] Implement logging for tracking script execution, successes, and points of failure.
